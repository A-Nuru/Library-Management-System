# Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document for Library-Management-System
### 1.	Introduction
Even in this time of modern technology, many libraries depends on the manual working for management of user records and book transactions. 
To overcome this, we introduce a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application by the name ‘Library Management System’ where all the
information of a particular library is stored on a central database which can be accessed only with proper authorisation.
The stored information includes user details, book details, available books, book issue and return dates, and fine
(In case a user fail to return the book within the given time period). This is a user friendly application that helps in
better book circulation and monitor transactions.

### 1.1	Purpose  
The key purpose of this project is to eliminate the paper work required to maintain records of user details and the book transactions. 
This application makes it easy for all the users to search for the available books along with their precise location inside the 
library. It makes the process of issuing and returning a book easy and quick.
