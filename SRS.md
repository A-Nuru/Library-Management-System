# Library-Management-System
## 1.	Introduction
Even in this time of modern technology, many libraries depends on the manual working for management of user records and book transactions. 
To overcome this, we introduce a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application by the name ‘Library Management System’ where all the 
information of a particular library is stored on a central database which can be accessed only with proper authorisation. 
The stored information includes user details, book details, available books, book issue and return dates, and fine (In case a user 
fail to return the book within the given time period). This is a user friendly application that helps in better book 
circulation and monitoring transactions.
